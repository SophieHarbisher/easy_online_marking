# easy_online_marking
A python script to easily generate comments for online marking.

To use simply run the python scipt ```marking.py'''.

This will first ask if you wish to generate a new mark scheme or use an existing saved mark scheme.
Next, you will be given the option to mark as many scripts according to the current mark scheme as you wish saving each feedback as a ```txt''' file.
It is then simple to copy and paste the feedback onto your online marking comments.
